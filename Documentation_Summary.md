   - Produces component loadings, regression coefficients, and heatmap visualizations

## Visualizations

The documentation includes the following visualizations:

1. **Annual Component Scores Heatmap**
   - Shows the evolution of component scores from 1996 to 2023
   - Provides a high-level overview of housing affordability trends

2. **Component Loadings**
   - Illustrates the relationship between variables and components
   - Shows which variables have the strongest influence on each component

3. **Period-Specific Component Scores**
   - Five charts showing component scores for each time period
   - Highlights key events and trends within each period

4. **2022-2023 Affordability Crisis**
   - Detailed analysis of the recent affordability crisis
   - Shows the unprecedented dual pressure from both components

5. **Regression Coefficients**
   - Visualizes the direct impact of each variable on housing affordability
   - Ranks variables by their influence on the Housing Affordability Index

## Key Findings

The documentation highlights several key findings:

1. Housing affordability is driven by two main components:
   - Housing market dynamics (mortgage rates, housing starts, residential investment)
   - Economic conditions (GDP, unemployment, prices)

2. Different time periods show distinct patterns of influence:
   - 1996-2000: Pre-Housing Boom
   - 2001-2006: Housing Boom
   - 2007-2012: Financial Crisis and Recovery
   - 2013-2018: Post-Crisis Period
   - 2019-2023: Recent Period including COVID-19 and Inflation

3. The 2022 affordability crisis was unique in showing strong positive scores in both components simultaneously, creating unprecedented pressure on housing affordability.

4. Early 2023 data suggests potential stabilization, with housing market pressures moderating and economic factors reaching equilibrium.

5. The model achieves an RÂ² of 0.3913, explaining 39.13% of the variance in housing affordability, which indicates reasonable explanatory power for a complex economic phenomenon.

## How to Use This Documentation
