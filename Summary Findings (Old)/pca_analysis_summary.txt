PCA Analysis of Housing Affordability Factors (1996-2022)

Key Findings:

1. Structural Changes in Housing Market Determinants:
   - Pre-2008: Market driven by fundamental factors (GDP, population, investment)
   - 2008-2011 Crisis: Shift to population and income as key drivers
   - Post-2008 Recovery: More balanced influence of factors
   - 2020-2022 Pandemic: Strong influence of construction and housing prices

2. Component Analysis:

First Principal Component (Market Fundamentals):
- Consistently explains 50-70% of variance
- Shows evolution from pure economic factors to include construction/price factors
- Lowest explanatory power during 2008-2011 crisis (50.92%)
- Highest during 2000-2003 tech recovery (69.56%)

Second Principal Component (Financial Conditions):
- Explains 14-23% of variance
- Pre-2008: Dominated by mortgage rates
- Crisis period: Shifted to inflation and GDP
- Post-crisis: Hybrid of rates and price changes
- Pandemic: Unique focus on supply (housing starts) and income

Third Principal Component (Market Dynamics):
- Explains 6-13% of variance
- Consistently captures price changes and market activity
- More influence from income during crisis periods

3. Period-Specific Insights:

1996-1999 (Pre-Tech Bubble):
- Traditional market fundamentals dominated
- Strong influence of GDP and population
- Mortgage rates key in second component

2000-2003 (Tech Bubble/Recovery):
- Highest concentration in first component (69.56%)
- Similar pattern to previous period
- Construction prices gained importance

2004-2007 (Housing Bubble):
- Construction prices became dominant
- Investment and housing starts more influential
- Early warning signs in price components

2008-2011 (Financial Crisis):
- Most dispersed variance across components
- Shift to population and income as key factors
- Unique importance of CPI and GDP in second component

2012-2015 (Post-Crisis Recovery):
- Return to fundamental factors
- Unemployment gained importance
- More balanced influence of price factors

2016-2019 (Pre-Pandemic):
- Very balanced factor influence
- Construction prices and unemployment key
- Strong mortgage rate influence returns

2020-2022 (Pandemic Period):
- High concentration in first two components (84.84%)
- Construction and housing prices dominant
- Unique emphasis on housing starts and income

4. Implications:

- Housing affordability factors have evolved significantly over time
- Crisis periods show distinct patterns from normal periods
- Recent pandemic period shows unique characteristics
- Construction prices and housing prices have gained importance over time
- Income's role becomes more critical during crisis periods

This analysis suggests that housing affordability is increasingly influenced by supply-side factors (construction prices, housing starts) while remaining sensitive to traditional economic fundamentals. The pandemic period has introduced new patterns, particularly in the relationship between supply, prices, and income.
