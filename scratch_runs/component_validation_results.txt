# PLS Regression Component Validation Results

## Overview
This document summarizes the validation of the optimal number of components for the PLS regression analysis of housing affordability factors.

## Methodology
The validation was performed using the Residual Variance Indicator (RVI) method, which calculates the residual variance for different numbers of components and determines when the change in RVI stabilizes (less than 5% change).

## Results

10          3.61716048      +0.990%        0.43633725

## Analysis

1. The RVI stabilization criterion (change < 5%) indicates that 2 is the optimal number of components.

2. R² Values:
   - R² for 1 component: 0.36937824 (explains ~37% of variance)
   - R² for 2 components: 0.39125829 (explains ~39% of variance)
   - R² for 3 components: 0.41505921 (explains ~42% of variance)

3. While adding a third component would increase the R² from ~39% to ~42%, the RVI stabilization criterion suggests that this improvement isn't substantial enough to justify the added complexity.

4. This validates the decision to use 2 components in the final PLS regression analysis, following the principle of parsimony - using the simplest model that adequately explains the data.

5. The first two components capture the most important patterns in the data while maintaining model simplicity and interpretability.

## Conclusion

The validation confirms that 2 is indeed the optimal number of components for the PLS regression analysis based on the RVI stabilization criterion. This aligns with the approach used in the final analysis.
