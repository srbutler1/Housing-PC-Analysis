# Housing Affordability Analysis (1996-2023)

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of housing affordability in the United States from 1996 to 2023 using Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression. The analysis examines how various economic and housing market factors influence the Housing Affordability Index (HAI) over time.

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals that housing affordability is driven by two main components:

1. **Housing Market Dynamics** (mortgage rates, housing starts, residential investment)
2. **Economic Conditions** (GDP, unemployment, prices)

Different time periods show distinct patterns of influence:
- 1996-2000: Pre-Housing Boom
- 2001-2006: Housing Boom
- 2007-2012: Financial Crisis and Recovery
- 2013-2018: Post-Crisis Period
- 2019-2023: Recent Period including COVID-19 and Inflation

The 2022 affordability crisis was unique in showing strong positive scores in both components simultaneously, creating unprecedented pressure on housing affordability.

## Methodology

The analysis uses Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression with 2 components, selected based on the Residual Variance Indicator (RVI) stabilization criterion. The model achieves an RÂ² of 0.3913, explaining 39.13% of the variance in housing affordability.

Variables were selected based on economic theory and organized into three categories:
- **Supply Factors**: Housing starts, PRFI, Vacancy rate
- **Demand Factors**: Population, DPI, Unemployment
- **Market Conditions**: Mortgage rate, MSPUS, CPI, PPI, GDP

All variables were normalized using max absolute value scaling to preserve the direction of change while making them comparable.
