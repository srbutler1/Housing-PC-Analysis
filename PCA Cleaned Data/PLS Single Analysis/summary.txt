# Housing Affordability Analysis Summary

## 1. Variables Used

| Variable | Description | Source |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Housing Starts | New residential construction starts | Federal Reserve |
| PRFI | Private Residential Fixed Investment | Federal Reserve |
| Vacancy Rate | Housing vacancy rate | Census Bureau |
| Population | US population | Census Bureau |
| DPI | Disposable Personal Income | Federal Reserve |
| Unemployment | Unemployment rate | Bureau of Labor Statistics |
| Mortgage Rate | 30-year fixed mortgage rate | Federal Reserve |
| MSPUS | Median Sales Price of Houses | Census Bureau |
| CPI | Consumer Price Index | Bureau of Labor Statistics |
| PPI | Producer Price Index | Bureau of Labor Statistics |
| GDP | Gross Domestic Product | Bureau of Economic Analysis |

## 2. Data Normalization

All variables were normalized using max absolute value scaling to preserve the sign of changes:

\[
x_i\_normalized = \frac{Δx_i}{\max(|Δx_i|)}
\]

where:
- Δx_i is the change in variable i
- max(|Δx_i|) is the maximum absolute change observed

This normalization method:
- Preserves the direction of change
- Bounds values between -1 and 1
- Maintains relative magnitudes of changes

## 3. Methodology

### Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression
- Used to identify key components driving housing affordability
- Selected 2 components based on RVI (Relative Variable Importance) stabilization
- Model R² = 0.3913 (explains 39.13% of variance in housing affordability)

### Component Calculation
Component scores for each time period t are calculated as:
\[
Score_{t,k} = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_{t,i} × w_{k,i})
\]
where:
- x_{t,i} is the normalized value of variable i at time t
- w_{k,i} is the loading of variable i on component k

## 5. Current State (Early 2023)

The most recent data shows:
1. Housing Market Component (1):
   - Moderating from peak pressure (+3.08 in 2022-Q2)
   - Current score: +0.56 (Q1 2023)
   - Indicates easing but still negative pressure on affordability

2. Economic Component (2):
   - Stabilizing near neutral
   - Current score: -0.01 (Q1 2023)
   - Suggests economic pressures on affordability are balancing

## 6. Conclusion

The analysis reveals:
1. Housing affordability is driven by two main components:
   - Housing market conditions (mortgage rates, starts, investment)
   - Broader economic factors (GDP, employment, prices)

2. The 2022 affordability crisis was unique in showing strong positive scores in both components:
   - Housing market pressures (high mortgage rates, low starts)
   - Economic pressures (strong GDP, low unemployment)

3. Early 2023 data suggests potential stabilization:
   - Housing market pressures moderating
   - Economic factors reaching equilibrium
   - However, overall affordability remains challenged

4. Model performance (R² = 0.3913) indicates:
   - Reasonable explanatory power for housing economics
   - Complex nature of housing affordability
   - Potential for additional factors not captured in current variables
