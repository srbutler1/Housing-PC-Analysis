==================================================

1. Data Preprocessing
-------------------
For each independent variable x_i, we calculate the quarter-over-quarter percent change:
    Δx_i = (x_i,t - x_i,t-1) / x_i,t-1 * 100

We then normalize using max absolute value scaling to preserve the direction of change:
    x_i_normalized = Δx_i / max(|Δx_i|)

This scaling method:
- Preserves the sign (direction) of changes
- Bounds values between -1 and 1
- Maintains relative magnitude of changes
- Allows for comparison between variables on different scales

2. Component Selection
--------------------
The number of components is determined using the Residual Variance Indicator (RVI):
    RVI_a = trace(X_a^T X_a) / trace(X_{a-1}^T X_{a-1})

where:
- X_a is the residual matrix after extracting a components
- The algorithm stops when RVI stabilizes (change < 2.5%)

3. PLS Regression Model
---------------------
The PLS regression follows these steps:

a) For each component a:
   - Calculate scores: t_a = X_{a-1} w_a
   - Calculate X loadings: p_a = X_{a-1}^T t_a / (t_a^T t_a)
   - Calculate Y loadings: q_a = y_{a-1}^T t_a / (t_a^T t_a)
   - Update X: X_a = X_{a-1} - t_a p_a^T
   - Update y: y_a = y_{a-1} - t_a q_a

b) Final regression equation:
    HAI = β_0 + Σ(β_i * x_i)
    where β_i are the regression coefficients

4. Time Period Analysis
---------------------
To analyze how drivers of housing affordability change over time:

a) Split data into periods:
   - 1996-2000: Pre-housing boom
   - 2001-2006: Housing boom
   - 2007-2012: Financial crisis and recovery
   - 2013-2018: Post-crisis period
   - 2019-2023: Recent period

b) For each period:
   - Calculate mean HAI
   - Calculate mean component scores
   - Identify top contributing variables through loading analysis

5. Interpretation
---------------
- Component loadings (p_a) show how variables relate to each component
- Significant loadings are those with |loading| > 0.35
- Component scores (t_a) show how each observation relates to components
- Regression coefficients (β_i) show direct effects on HAI
- Time period analysis reveals how drivers change over different market conditions

6. Model Evaluation
-----------------
- R² measures total variance explained in HAI
- Individual component contributions show incremental variance explained
- Loading patterns reveal underlying market dynamics
- Temporal analysis shows evolution of housing affordability drivers
